99910,Puzzle Pirates,"This game has some serious problems. First of all it's 2d, so it should be very easy for any computer to handle it, because it's not even 'high graphics' 2d with effects and stuff, it's very basic, so it SHOULD NOT produce ANY HEAT at ALL! instead this game makes my processor go from 41c to 60c! sniper elite v2 dosent even get me to 55c!",-1,0
99910,Puzzle Pirates,"This game is good but also horrible. Its fun to play but that fact that everything requires real money to buy or a riduclous amount of in game money, it just feels like one big chore. Just to play poker it costs money. Granted I really like the game but it needs work. Also, the server crashes everyday. Fun game to play BUT DONT WASTE ANY MONEY ON IT.",-1,0

99910,Puzzle Pirates,"I really ove this game but it needs somethings. It's basically a Puzzle MMO. It's pay to play in that you have to get badges to have access to everything all at once. You dont have to pay but you need to grind hardcore to get sufficient in game currency to buy badges. Now, This game is a blast when there are lots of people playing. Like 5 years ago. Now it's a ghost town. You can still find some crews. This game needs a serious revamp, New Puzzles maybe just update the puzzles. But it is fun and very addicting considering all that.",-1,0
99910,Puzzle Pirates,"Used to play Puzzel Pirates 'way back when', before it was on Steam... Hardly no voyages going, everything locked behind doubloons and badges (labour badges, really? Cmon...). There's no one around, it's a ghost town and other than the obvious paywall introduction (someone has to pay for the doubloons), a few 'tacky' games introduced, the games not really changed, or updated.  Still haven't figured out how to move the world with the character? No interface updates? Nothing? Lil' disappointing.   Three Rings, just what the fudge happened?",-1,0
99910,Puzzle Pirates,"This game was aright, though a bit annoying. When I selected a puzzle, it would take me to the house it was located in, then I would have to wander around until I found the right area. When I was playing a puzzle I enjoyed, the duty pop up is ANNOYING. I just decided to delete it.",-1,0
99910,Puzzle Pirates,"I had a nice review to recommend this game, but did you know if you don't purchase anything in Puzzle Pirates, your account gets deleted if you don't log in for a while? Check this:  https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Purged#Purging   tl:dr, Puzzle Pirates doesn't care if you go offline for a while. Three Rings WON'T revive your account if it's deleted. This F2P game isn't F2P.",-1,0
99910,Puzzle Pirates,"The puzzles in this game are fun, but you have to pay to do basically anything, and then everything expires. Buying something for a game that you are only going to play for a few hours maybe once or twice a week,but it is going to expire in two weeks...very stupid. Experence also expires. I really wish they would just get rid of everything that expires and then only made me pay for stuff once...until then not worth the money. All puzzles can be played for free across the internet. All things that make this game unique and interesting, require money.",-1,0
